# Snake-Arduino
Simple Snake Game on the Arduino

######I've seen quite a few snake projects online and I just wasn't too happy about the code I saw. Here is what sets mine apart. 
1. Doesn't let you go through walls, you will die.
2. Only left or right button instead of up, down, left, right buttons.
3. Actually has a death screen and resets afterwards.
4. Speeds up over time. 
3. Semi random start and random first fruit rather than hardcoded. 
4. Erases old dots manually instead of wiping the whole screen every cycle which causes certain flicker issues. 
5. No dynamic arrays.
6. Pretty simple. I think at least.

It's not the cleanest or prettiest but it's not bad.
